## Project Setup and Execution

This project consists of a simple collection of shell scripts. As of now, it only has one file: `stats-runner.sh`.

Follow the steps below to setup and run the project:

1. **Environment Setup**: The project requires certain environment variables to be set. These variables should be declared in a `.env` file at the root of the project. If the file doesn't exist, create one.
2. **Running the script**: After setting up the environment, run the `stats-runner.sh` script. This can be done by navigating to the project root in your terminal and executing the command `./stats-runner.sh`.

Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute the script. If the script is not executable, you might need to run `chmod +x stats-runner.sh` to make it executable.
