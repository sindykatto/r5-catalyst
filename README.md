## Getting Started

The r5-catalyst project is made up of a few simple shell scripts:

- `stats-runner.sh`
- `player.sh`

To setup and run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Environment**: Certain variables need to be defined in the environment for the project to work correctly. These variables are stored in a `.env` file located at the project's root level. If this file is missing, create one.
2. **Script Execution**: Once the environment is ready, you can run the scripts. To do this, open your terminal, navigate to the root of the project, and use the command `./<script name>`.

Before executing, ensure that the scripts have the correct permissions. If not, you might need to modify the script's permissions using `chmod +x <script name>` to allow execution.
